I love travelling and experiencing different scenes. I grow up in mainland China and went to Hong Kong to study when I was 18. I finished my undergraduate there. I have been exchanged in Cambridge for a semester and now I am a master student in [**London Business School**](https://www.london.edu/about). 

I love pets very much and desired to have my own dog.
Here is an image of my ideal dog. ![dog](https://ggsc.s3.amazonaws.com/images/uploads/The_Science-Backed_Benefits_of_Being_a_Dog_Owner.jpg)

* Name : Bob
* Wife name : Julie
* Age : 3
* Children : 1 daughter & 1 son
