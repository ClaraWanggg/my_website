---

I graduated from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) , majoring Accounting and Finance. With over 80 years of proud tradition and ranking among the world’s top 100 institutions, PolyU aspires to be a leading university with world-class research and education. In the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings by Subject 2022, PolyU was ranked in the top 100 globally in four disciplines – **25th in Business and Economics, ranking No.1 in Hong Kong**! 

This warm place teaches me how to love and cooperate, giving the instructions to be a supportive person. If you want to or plan to come Hong Kong, don't be hesitated! I can be your guidance!
